Votingmachine Smart Contract
This repository contains a Solidity smart contract Votingmachine that allows users to vote and manages the total votes cast.

Features
Owner: The contract owner deploys the contract and manages its operations.
Voting: Users can vote by specifying the number of votes they wish to cast, with limits to prevent exceeding 250 votes per user.
Safety Checks: The contract uses require, revert, and assert statements to ensure safe and correct operation.
Requirements
Solidity compiler version ^0.8.18 or compatible.
Truffle or Remix for development and testing (optional).
Deployment
Compile the Contract:

Use a Solidity compiler to compile the Votingmachine.sol file.
Deploy the Contract:

Deploy the compiled contract to a Ethereum-compatible blockchain network.
Interact with the Contract:

Use a web interface, or directly interact with the contract through Ethereum wallets like MetaMask.
